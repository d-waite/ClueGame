For the testCellInitials test, we chose four different cells. The first cell was a walkway, the second
was a room, the third was an unused space, and the fourth a secrect doorway. In addition to testing the label
of the secret doorway we also tested the .getSeceretPassage method which tells us where the passage leads.

For the testCenterAndLabel test, we chose two different rooms, the Stable and the lookout, which have
different orientations of their centers and labels. We tested the locations of the center and the label,
but we also tested that random edge cells and secret passage cells aren't marked as center or label.

In the testDoorways test, we tested a doorway of each type, and also tested a cell that were next to doorways
to make sure that the edge cases didn't cause any problems. We also tested a cell that is inside a room that isn't a
doorway.
